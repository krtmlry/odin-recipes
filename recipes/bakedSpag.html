    <h1 class="headers"> Ingredients </h1>
    <ul class="ingredients">
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package spaghetti
        <li>1 pound ground beef
        <li>1 onion, chopped
        <li>1 (32 ounce) jar meatless spaghetti sauce
        <li>½ teaspoon seasoned salt
        <li>2 eggs
        <li>⅓ cup grated Parmesan cheese
        <li>5 tablespoons butter, melted
        <li>2 cups small curd cottage cheese, divided
        <li>5 cups shredded mozzarella cheese, divided

    </ul>
    <h1 class="headers"> Directions </h1>
    <ol class="directions">
        <li>Step 1 <br>
            Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.

        <li>Step 2 <br>
        Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender but firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain.

        <li>Step 3 <br>
        Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir beef and onion in the hot skillet until meat is browned and onion is soft and translucent, about 7 minutes. Drain excess oil from the pan. Stir in spaghetti sauce and seasoned salt.

        <li>Step 4 <br>
        Whisk eggs, Parmesan, and butter in a large bowl. Add spaghetti and toss to coat.

        <li>Step 5 <br>
        Place 1/2 of the spaghetti mixture in the prepared dish. Top with 1/2 of the cottage cheese, 2 cups mozzarella, and 1/2 of meat sauce. Repeat layers. Cover with aluminum foil.

        <li>Step 6 <br>
        Bake in the preheated oven for 40 minutes. Remove the foil and sprinkle with remaining mozzarella. Continue to bake until cheese is melted and lightly browned, 20 to 25 minutes.
